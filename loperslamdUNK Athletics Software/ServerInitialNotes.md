# Notes On The Initial Idea for the Server
---
## Original Source
[Click here](https://github.com/TheGreymanShow/web_application_using_sql) to visit TheGreymanShow's GitHub project we will be building off of.

## Details
The original application is a simple SQL web server application.
We will repurpose this application so that the database's tables
store data about coaches, athletes, their messages, and the coaches' announcements.

## SQL Server Hosting
We will be using Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio to host and manage the SQL server our project will interact with.

## How we will create the SQL Database
We will build the database by running queries to create all of the tables we will need, as well as the stored procedures if necessary.

## How we will host the SQL Server
For now we will host the SQL Server on one of our own devices.
Please see [this link](https://voiptools.com/docs/configure-sql-server-for-remote-access-over-internet/) for more details.

## How to install SSMS & SQL Server
SQL Server is used to host the obvious. SSMS is used to manage said server. Here are links to download both (although you can just download SSMS via the SQL Server installer...):
