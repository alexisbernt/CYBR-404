Career-based Networking Best Practices

As graduation approaches something I have thought about is future work. I am hoping to apply the skills I've learned in a professional setting to solve problems. Day to day tasks I really enjoy include communication with others, programming, writing, learning, and building. I believe that highlighting these tasks I enjoy doing will help me land the right job. In class, Professor Spanier spoke about making a good impression. Something Professor Spanier mentioned was dressing nice but wearing something that helps you be memorable and stand out. Being memorable separates one from the rest of the canidates. I believe that being friendly and smiling also helps in the job application process. Finally, asking questions is important. Not just any questions though. Researching companies and synthesizing questions based off research is a good method of preperation. Job fairs, using connections within one's personal network, software applications like LinkedIn, and the university are all great resources when it comes to finding jobs. Beginning the job hunt early is also important. That way there is plenty of time to look for options and make adjustments. Searching for a job early likewise signals strong organization skills.
